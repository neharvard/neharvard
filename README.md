# Current Overview


👋 Hello there! I'm Umme Neha, a final-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems.

🎓 Currently in my last year of CSE, I thrive on the challenges posed by competitive programming. I enjoy diving into algorithmic puzzles and data structures, constantly honing my problem-solving skills.

💻 My journey extends beyond competitive programming—I'm an enthusiastic explorer of development, always seeking to expand my knowledge base. Whether it's web development, software engineering, or exploring new technologies, I'm keen on learning and growing in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

🌟 I believe in the power of continuous learning and hands-on experience. Through GitHub, I showcase my projects, experiments, and contributions as I delve deeper into the realms of both competitive programming and Development.

🚀 When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, participating in hackathons, or engaging in collaborative projects that push boundaries and foster innovation.


Happy coding! 😊💻
